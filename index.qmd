# Preface {.unnumbered}

This website contains section notes for STAT 210: Probability I, a graduate level probability course at Harvard University taught by Professor [Joe Blitzstein](mailto:blitz@g.harvard.edu). These notes are created by [Zad Chin](mailto:zadchin@college.harvard.edu) and [Jarell Cheong Tze Wen](mailto:jarellcheong@college.harvard.edu). 

## Logistics

- Sections: 12:00 - 1:15 pm on Fridays at SC112
- Office Hours: 1:30 - 2:45pm on Fridays at SC222

In section, we will only briefly go through the results from class, focusing more on pencil problems that will strengthen your understanding about those results. Section notes will be posted here before Friday (latest by Thursday night), and section notes with solutions will be posted after section (on Friday night). Please note that the solution to the pencil problem is not the official solution but more of the result of discussion with peers. If you find any error or mistakes, please report them on Github. Furthermore, feel free to upload the pencil problem you wish to be discussed in the following section at the link [here](https://forms.gle/RBmMNYJp4u3qD5W79).

In office hours, we will mostly discuss concepts or problems on the presently assigned homework. Besides section and office hours, please feel free to ask questions on Ed, or email Joe or us as well.
