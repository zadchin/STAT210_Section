# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a set of section notes for STAT 210: Probability I, a graduate level probability course, at Harvard University taught by Professor [Joe Blitzstein](mailto:blitz@g.harvard.edu), created by [Zad Chin](mailto:zadchin@college.harvard.edu) & [Jarell Cheong Tze Wen](mailto:jarellcheong@college.harvard.edu). 

## Important Logistics

- Section Time: 12:00 - 1:00 pm every Friday at SC316

In Section, we will only briefly go through definition highlights in class, and focus more on pencil problems that will strengthen understandings for those concepts/definitions. Section note will be posted here before Friday (latest by Thursday night), and section note with solution will be posted after section (on Friday night). 

In office hour, we will mainly discuss concept or problem on this week's homework. Besides Section & Office Hours, please feel free to ask questions on Ed, or email Joe or us as well.

Our appreciation also goes to our peers from STAT 210, whose contributions to discussions
on the textbook problems have been invaluable. Finally, we are indebted to the Stat-exchange platform for facilitating discussions that addressed challenges we encountered, which have subsequently
enriched the content of our section notes.
